# Daily-Planner

## Description
This daily planner can be used to keep track of a person's daily tasks throughout business hours. I was encouraged to build this in order to gain experience using jquery, bootstrap and dayjs. It has been a good introduction to third party API's for me. My biggest challenge was jquery. Till now I haven't deviated from the standard javascript language so getting used to the jquery abbreviations was a challenge and required me to go out and research alot more.
